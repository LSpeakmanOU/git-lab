   restore           Restore working tree files
   rm                Remove files from the working tree and from the index
   sparse-checkout   Initialize and modify the sparse-checkout

examine the history and state (see also: git help revisions)
   bisect            Use binary search to find the commit that introduced a bug
   diff              Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc
   grep              Print lines matching a pattern
   log               Show commit logs
   show              Show various types of objects
   status            Show the working tree status

grow, mark and tweak your common history
   branch            List, create, or delete branches
   commit            Record changes to the repository
   merge             Join two or more development histories together
   rebase            Reapply commits on top of another base tip
   reset             Reset current HEAD to the specified state
   switch            Switch branches
   tag               Create, list, delete or verify a tag object signed with GPG

collaborate (see also: git help workflows)
   fetch             Download objects and refs from another repository

Answer 10: No the local readme is different from the one online.

Answer 11:
To https://github.com/LSpeakmanOU/git-lab.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)       
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/LSpeakmanOU/git-lab.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another 
repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.        
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

Answer 12: Yes the changes showed up in local README.
